**Buzz** is a counting game.

Each person takes a turn saying the next number in sequence:
1, 2, 3, etc.
When you reach 7, or a number that's multiple of 7, such as 14, 28, etc.
Or, if the number itself has a 7 in it, such as 17, 27, 37, etc.
then you should say "buzz" instead of the number itself.
Example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, buzz, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, buzz, 15, 16, buzz, 18, 19, 20, buzz

Also, you can't say buzz unless it's time to say buzz.

Scoring:
- You get 7 points each time you say the right number (or buzz)
-   If someone else didn't have a turn, and you played again, then you get 1 point.
- You get 70 points deducted when you say buzz at the wrong time, or don't say buzz when you should.
